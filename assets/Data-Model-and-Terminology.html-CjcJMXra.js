The hierarchical from top to bottom is: power group layer - power plant layer - entity layer - measurement layer. ROOT is the root node, and each node of measurement layer is a leaf node. In the process of using IoTDB, the attributes on the path from ROOT node is directly connected to each leaf node with &quot;.&quot;, thus forming the name of a timeseries in IoTDB. For example, The left-most path in Figure 2.1 can generate a timeseries named <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code>.</p><center><img style="width:100%;max-width:800px;max-height:600px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/github/122668849-b1c69280-d1ec-11eb-83cb-3b73c40bdf72.png"></center><p>Here are the basic concepts of the model involved in IoTDB.</p><h2 id="measurement-entity-database-path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-entity-database-path"><span>Measurement, Entity, Database, Path</span></a></h2><h3 id="measurement-also-called-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-also-called-field"><span>Measurement (Also called field)</span></a></h3><p>It is information measured by detection equipment in an actual scene and can transform the sensed information into an electrical signal or other desired form of information output and send it to IoTDB.

Provided that there are four timeseries <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code>, <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature</code>, <code>root.ln.wf02.wt02.hardware</code>, <code>root.ln.wf02.wt02.status</code>, two devices <code>wf01</code>, <code>wf02</code> under the path <code>root.ln</code> may belong to the same owner or the same manufacturer, so d1 and d2 are closely related. At this point, the prefix path root.vehicle can be designated as a database, which will enable IoTDB to store all devices under it in the same folder. Newly added devices under <code>root.ln</code> will also belong to this database.</p><p>In general, it is recommended to create 1 database.</p><blockquote><p>Note1: A full path (<code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code> as in the above example) is not allowed to be set as a database.</p><p>Note2: The prefix of a timeseries must belong to a database. Before creating a timeseries, users must set which database the series belongs to. Only timeseries whose database is set can be persisted to disk.</p><p>Note3: The number of character in the path as database, including <code>root.</code>, shall not exceed 64.</p></blockquote><p>Once a prefix path is set as a database, the database settings cannot be changed.</p><p>After a database is set, the ancestral layers, children and descendant layers of the corresponding prefix path are not allowed to be set up again (for example, after <code>root.ln</code> is set as the database, the root layer and <code>root.ln.wf01</code> are not allowed to be created as database).</p><p>The Layer Name of database can only consist of characters, numbers, and underscores, like <code>root.storagegroup_1</code>.</p><p><strong>Schema-less writing</strong>: When metadata is not defined, data can be directly written through an insert statement, and the required metadata will be automatically recognized and registered in the database, achieving automatic modeling.</p><h3 id="path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#path"><span>Path</span></a></h3><p>A <code>path</code> is an expression that conforms to the following constraints:</p><div class="language-sql line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="sql" data-title="sql" style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf;"><pre class="shiki one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#C678DD;">path</span><span style="color:#ABB2BF;">       </span></span>
