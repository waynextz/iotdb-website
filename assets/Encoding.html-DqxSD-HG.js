In the process of writing and reading data, the amount of data involved in the I/O operations can be reduced to improve performance. IoTDB supports the following encoding methods for different data types:</p><ul><li>PLAIN</li></ul><p>PLAIN encoding, the default encoding mode, i.e, no encoding, supports multiple data types. It has high compression and decompression efficiency while suffering from low space storage efficiency.</p><ul><li>TS_2DIFF</li></ul><p>Second-order differential encoding is more suitable for encoding monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence data, and is not recommended for sequence data with large fluctuations.</p><ul><li>RLE</li></ul><p>Run-length encoding is suitable for storing sequence with continuous values, and is not recommended for sequence data with most of the time different values.</p><p>Run-length encoding can also be used to encode floating-point numbers, while it is necessary to specify reserved decimal digits (MAX_POINT_NUMBER) when creating time series. It is more suitable to store sequence data where floating-point values appear continuously, monotonously increasing or decreasing, and it is not suitable for storing sequence data with high precision requirements after the decimal point or with large fluctuations.</p><blockquote><p>TS_2DIFF and RLE have precision limit for data type of float and double. By default, two decimal places are reserved. GORILLA is recommended.</p></blockquote><ul><li>GORILLA</li></ul><p>GORILLA encoding is lossless. It is more suitable for numerical sequence with similar values and is not recommended for sequence data with large fluctuations.</p><p>Currently, there are two versions of GORILLA encoding implementation, it is recommended to use <code>GORILLA</code> instead of <code>GORILLA_V1</code> (deprecated).</p><p>Usage restrictions: When using GORILLA to encode INT32 data, you need to ensure that there is no data point with the value <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> in the sequence. When using GORILLA to encode INT64 data, you need to ensure that there is no data point with the value <code>Long.MIN_VALUE</code> in the sequence.</p><ul><li>DICTIONARY</li></ul><p>DICTIONARY encoding is lossless. It is suitable for TEXT data with low cardinality (i.e. low number of distinct values). It is not recommended to use it for high-cardinality data.</p><h2 id="correspondence-between-data-type-and-encoding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#correspondence-between-data-type-and-encoding"><span>Correspondence between data type and encoding</span></a></h2><p>The five encodings described in the previous sections are applicable to different data types.
