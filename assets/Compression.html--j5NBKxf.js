Although both encoding and compression are designed to improve storage efficiency, encoding techniques are usually available only for specific data types (e.g., second-order differential encoding is only suitable for INT32 or INT64 data type, and storing floating-point numbers requires multiplying them by 10m to convert to integers), after which the data is converted to a binary stream.
