Slots are logical entities, and in an IoTDB cluster, the <strong>SchemaSlots</strong> and <strong>DataSlots</strong> are defined as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>SchemaSlot:</strong> A SchemaSlot represents a subset of the time series&#39; schema collection. The total number of SchemaSlots is fixed, with a default value of 1000. IoTDB uses a hashing algorithm to evenly distribute all devices across these SchemaSlots.</li><li><strong>DataSlot:</strong> A DataSlot represents a subset of the time series&#39; data collection. Based on the SchemaSlots, the data for corresponding devices is further divided into DataSlots by a fixed time interval. The default time interval for a DataSlot is 7 days.</li></ul><h2 id="region" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#region"><span>Region</span></a></h2><p>In IoTDB, time series&#39; schema and data are replicated across DataNodes to ensure high availability in the cluster. However, replicating data at the slot level can increase management complexity and reduce write throughput. To address this, IoTDB introduces the concept of <strong>Region</strong>, which groups SchemaSlots and DataSlots into <strong>SchemaRegions</strong> and <strong>DataRegions</strong> respectively. Replication is then performed at the Region level. The definitions of SchemaRegion and DataRegion are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>SchemaRegion</strong>: A SchemaRegion is the basic unit for storing and replicating time series&#39; schema. All SchemaSlots in a database are evenly distributed across the database&#39;s SchemaRegions. SchemaRegions with the same RegionID are replicas of each other. For example, in the figure above, SchemaRegion-1 has three replicas located on DataNode-1, DataNode-2, and DataNode-3.</li><li><strong>DataRegion</strong>: A DataRegion is the basic unit for storing and replicating time series&#39; data. All DataSlots in a database are evenly distributed across the database&#39;s DataRegions. DataRegions with the same RegionID are replicas of each other. For instance, in the figure above, DataRegion-2 has two replicas located on DataNode-1 and DataNode-2.</li></ul><h2 id="replica-groups" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#replica-groups"><span>Replica Groups</span></a></h2><p>Region replicas are critical for the fault tolerance of the cluster. Each Region&#39;s replicas are organized into <strong>replica groups</strong>, where the replicas are assigned roles as either <strong>leader</strong> or <strong>follower</strong>, working together to provide read and write services.
