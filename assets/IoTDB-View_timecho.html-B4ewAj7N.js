However, at this point, the user is able to rename it using the sequence view feature, map it to a sequence view, and use <code>root.view.device001.temperature</code> to access the captured data.</p><h3 id="_1-2-application-scenario-2-simplifying-business-layer-query-logic" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-application-scenario-2-simplifying-business-layer-query-logic"><span>1.2 Application Scenario 2 Simplifying business layer query logic</span></a></h3><p>Sometimes users have a large number of devices that manage a large number of time series. When conducting a certain business, the user wants to deal with only some of these sequences. At this time, the focus of attention can be picked out by the sequence view function, which is convenient for repeated querying and writing.</p><p><strong>For example</strong>: Users manage a product assembly line with a large number of time series for each segment of the equipment.

Therefore, the concept of sequence views in IoTDB is also built on sequences.</p><p>A sequence view is a virtual time series, and each virtual time series is like a soft link or shortcut that maps to a sequence or some kind of computational logic external to a certain view. In other words, a virtual sequence either maps to some defined external sequence or is computed from multiple external sequences.</p><p>Users can create views using complex SQL queries, where the sequence view acts as a stored query statement, and when data is read from the view, the stored query statement is used as the source of the data in the FROM clause.</p><h3 id="_2-3-alias-sequences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-alias-sequences"><span>2.3 Alias Sequences</span></a></h3><p>There is a special class of beings in a sequence view that satisfy all of the following conditions:</p><ol><li>the data source is a single time series</li><li>there is no computational logic</li><li>no filtering conditions (e.g., no WHERE clause restrictions).</li></ol><p>Such a sequence view is called an <strong>alias sequence</strong>, or alias sequence view.

The data type of a view is inferred from the original time series type of the query statement or alias sequence that defines the view.

For example, a time series of type int32 was originally placed in the same view as other series of type int64. I now want all the data queried through the view to be automatically converted to int64 type.</p><blockquote><p>Ans: This is not the function of the sequence view.
