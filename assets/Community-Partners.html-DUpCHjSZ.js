For instance, &quot;IoTDB BigDataProduct&quot; is inappropriate because it contains &quot;IoTDB.&quot; However, exceptions such as &quot;BigDataProduct, powered by Apache IoTDB&quot; or &quot;BigDataProduct for Apache IoTDB&quot; are acceptable, as they incorporate the full &quot;Apache IoTDB&quot; name. For software identifiers like Maven coordinates or module names, using formats like &quot;iotdb-tool&quot; is permissible.
