People collect various states of devices by installing sensors on them. If the motor collects voltage and current, the blade speed, angular velocity, and power generation of the fan; Vehicle collection of latitude and longitude, speed, and fuel consumption; The vibration frequency, deflection, displacement, etc. of the bridge. The data collection of sensors has penetrated into various industries.</p><figure><img src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/20240505154735.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Generally speaking, we refer to each collection point as a measurement point (also known as a physical quantity, time series, timeline, signal quantity, indicator, measurement value, etc.). Each measurement point continuously collects new data information over time, forming a time series. In the form of a table, each time series is a table formed by two columns: time and value; In a graphical way, each time series is a trend chart formed over time, which can also be vividly referred to as the device&#39;s electrocardiogram.</p><figure><img src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/20240505154843.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The massive time series data generated by sensors is the foundation of digital transformation in various industries, so our modeling of time series data mainly focuses on equipment and sensors.</p><h2 id="key-concepts-of-time-series-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts-of-time-series-data"><span>Key Concepts of Time Series Data</span></a></h2><p>The main concepts involved in time-series data can be divided from bottom to top: data points, measurement points, and equipment.</p><figure><img src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/20240505154513.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3 id="data-point" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-point"><span>Data Point</span></a></h3><ul><li>Definition: Consists of a timestamp and a value, where the timestamp is of type long and the value can be of various types such as BOOLEAN, FLOAT, INT32, etc.</li><li>Example: A row of a time series in the form of a table in the above figure, or a point of a time series in the form of a graph, is a data point.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/20240505154432.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3 id="measurement-points" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-points"><span>Measurement Points</span></a></h3><ul><li>Definition: It is a time series formed by multiple data points arranged in increments according to timestamps.
