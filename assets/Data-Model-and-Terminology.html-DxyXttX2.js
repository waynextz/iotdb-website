The hierarchical from top to bottom is: power group layer - power plant layer - entity layer - measurement layer. ROOT is the root node, and each node of measurement layer is a leaf node. In the process of using IoTDB, the attributes on the path from ROOT node is directly connected to each leaf node with &quot;.&quot;, thus forming the name of a timeseries in IoTDB. For example, The left-most path in Figure 2.1 can generate a timeseries named <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code>.</p><center><img style="width:100%;max-width:800px;max-height:600px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/github/122668849-b1c69280-d1ec-11eb-83cb-3b73c40bdf72.png"></center><p>Here are the basic concepts of the model involved in IoTDB.</p><h2 id="measurement-entity-storage-group-path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-entity-storage-group-path"><span>Measurement, Entity, Storage Group, Path</span></a></h2><h3 id="measurement-also-called-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-also-called-field"><span>Measurement (Also called field)</span></a></h3><p>It is information measured by detection equipment in an actual scene and can transform the sensed information into an electrical signal or other desired form of information output and send it to IoTDB.

At this point, the prefix path root.vehicle can be designated as a storage group, which will enable IoTDB to store all devices under it in the same folder. Newly added devices under <code>root.ln</code> will also belong to this storage group.</p><blockquote><p>Note1: A full path (<code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code> as in the above example) is not allowed to be set as a storage group.</p><p>Note2: The prefix of a timeseries must belong to a storage group. Before creating a timeseries, users must set which storage group the series belongs to. Only timeseries whose storage group is set can be persisted to disk.</p></blockquote><p>Once a prefix path is set as a storage group, the storage group settings cannot be changed.</p><p>After a storage group is set, the ancestral layers, children and descendant layers of the corresponding prefix path are not allowed to be set up again (for example, after <code>root.ln</code> is set as the storage group, the root layer and <code>root.ln.wf01</code> are not allowed to be set as storage groups).</p><p>The Layer Name of storage group can only consist of characters, numbers and underscores, like <code>root.storagegroup_1</code>.</p><h3 id="path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#path"><span>Path</span></a></h3><p>A <code>path</code> is an expression that conforms to the following constraints:</p><div class="language-sql line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sql" data-title="sql"><pre class="language-sql"><code>path
